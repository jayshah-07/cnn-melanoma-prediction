# Melanoma-CNN-Prediction
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

## General Information
- In this project, we tried to develop a model using cnn to identify tyoe if cancer specifically Melanoma. 
- If Melanoma cancer is detected or suspected at early stages, it can reduce suffering for patient and dermatologists can start dignosis more accurately. The objective of this project is to analyse the pictorial dataset and come up with a CNN model to predict the cancer on basis of the image of the skin spot.

## Conclusions
- Training accuracy is 85.61 and Validation accuracy is 84.86 which is really good.
- Since, we had uneven proportion of image sample for different type of cancer, after rebalance, training and validation accuracy were imporved.
